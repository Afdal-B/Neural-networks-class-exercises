# Neural Networks Class Exercises

This repository contains the exercises I have completed during the Neural Networks course. The exercises are implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and Python.

## Exercises

1. **Perceptron**
   - Introduction to the Perceptron algorithm
   - Implementation and training of a Perceptron model

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
   - Overview of Recurrent Neural Networks
   - Synchronous and asynchronous recurrent Neural Networks

3. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
   - Implementation of an OCR system using recurrent neural networks

4. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
   - Overview of Multilayer Perceptrons
   - Implementation and training of an MLP model
